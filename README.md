# birdfish
flight of non rigid airfoil. 

The first file v2 is flight tested. 
That said there was a minor issue with some code.
It was corrected. Many sensors are initialized, but only GPS is used. 

In the V4 file. Lessons learned are added. Goal Radius becomes a variable. 
Gains for altitude are introduced. 
Calculations are put in better places. 

Cheers.
